Simple UI for Apple Container CLI.

currently this project uses https://github.com/apple/container as backend, so make sure it is installed.

Very basic functionallity at the moment. The program will create a Menu Bar App that shows the status of the Container system as well as the amount of running containers when clicked on it.
When clicking "open Container View" you can open the full App that at the time, shows all containers, images and volumes.

It supports very basic container and volume creation UI at the moment but will be expanded in the future.
